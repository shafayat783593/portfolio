        <p>
          My programming journey began with curiosity and passion during my diploma
          studies in computer science. From learning the basics of HTML and CSS to
          mastering React and Node.js, I have embraced every step as an opportunity
          to create meaningful digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building interactive, responsive, and user-friendly frontend
          applications that delight users and solve real problems. Writing clean
          code and collaborating with others inspire me every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside programming, I love playing football and badminton, and Iâ€™m
          passionate about photography and painting. These hobbies keep my
          creativity flowing and help me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a motivated and enthusiastic learner who enjoys challenges and
          continuous improvement. I believe in blending technical skills with
          creativity to craft beautiful and functional web applications.
